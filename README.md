# GitHacked

This is a repo for a script file that I am working on, the intention of this is to make a cron job that activates x amount of times a day and does a task. 

Currently I have been able to make the message appear in the terminal, as a cron job... 

What I am currently working on is another file to stop the process of the hack, I was thinking also if I could change the commands when the file is being sourced.


How to install:

1) Aquire someone's unguarded laptop
2) Clone this repo (easier if you clone it to their root): https://github.com/Rrhino101/GitHacked.git
3) Go into GitHacked folder (cd GitHacked)
3) Source the . hacked file (source .hacked)
4) Run the hax command
5) Click OK on the pop up

There you go, its all finished! If you wanna test it out on your pc and want to stop it run :crontab -r
It will remove all of your cron jobs, so be cautious if you have any current.
