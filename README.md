# GitHacked

This is a repo for a script file that I am working on, the intention of this is to make a cron job that activates x amount of times a day and does a task. 

Currently I have been able to make the message appear in the terminal, as a cron job... 

What I am currently working on is another file to stop the process of the hack, I was thinking also if I could change the commands when the file is being sourced.


How to install:

1) Aquire someone's unguarded laptop
2) Clone this repo (easier if you clone it to their root): https://github.com/Rrhino101/GitHacked.git
3) Go into GitHacked folder (cd GitHacked)
3) Source the .uwu file (source .uwu)
4) Run the uwu command
5) Click OK on the pop up (Not sure if it does the same for windows, still need to try it)

There you go, its all finished! If you wanna test it out on your pc and want to stop it run : unhack
When you run it you'll need to press yes to the pop up:
I've made it so that it removes the last crontab from the list of crontabs so the person you're hacking doesn't have to set up all of their,
crontabs again :)

Look through my code and change it as you see fit!
