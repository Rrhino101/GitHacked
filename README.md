# GitHacked

This is a repo for a script file that I am working on, the intention of this is to make a cron job that activates x amount of times a day and does a task. 

Sor far; all this does is print Hi to a terminal, the problem is that the terminal used is one that I have the name of. 

For a work around I want to make it so that the terminal used is either one already open//in use or a new terminal that opens up.
